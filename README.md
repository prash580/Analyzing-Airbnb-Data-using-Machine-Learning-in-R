- K Nearest Neighbor segregates the three types of room i.e Private,Shared and Entire house/Apartment from the training data given. The K value is given as the square root of the number of samples. 

- Multiple Linear Regression was used to estimate the price of the room based on various factors which are taken as predictor variables, some of the variables were not considered as predictors due to Multicollinearity.
